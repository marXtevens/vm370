Specify handling options.  The expression is evaluated, and individual words
in the result that are meaningful to bREXX will be obeyed (these might control
optimizations, enforce standards, enable implementation-dependent features,
etc.).  Words in the result that are not recognized will be ignored (they are
assumed to be instructions to a different Rexx implementation).

bREXX supports the following options, which are processed case-independently:

   [NO]STORAGE_DECIMAL - Specifies how to treat the address argument of the
   STORAGE() built-in function.  With STORAGE_DECIMAL, it is treated as a
   decimal value, as bREXX did before release 1.1.0.  The default, which can be
   specified by NOSTORAGE_DECIMAL, is to treat the address as a hexadecimal
   value.
