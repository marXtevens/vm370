NOTE: This REXX implementation does not currently support the NAME keyword.

This instruction either diverts the path of execution to another instruction,
or establishes a handler for a condition that will divert at a later time.  If
the labelname parameter is specified, the program diverts execution to the
instruction with the corresponding label.  If the VALUE keyword is specified or
implied, the expression is evaluated and its value specifies the label to
divert to.  The keyword may be omitted if the expression starts with a special
character.  If the ON keyword is specified, this instruction causes execution
to be diverted to the the specified traplabel, which defaults to the condition
name, when the specified condition occurs.  If the OFF keyword is specified,
any existing handling for the specified condition is terminated.

When the path of execution is diverted by a signal, all active control
structures (i.e., DO, IF, INTERPRET, and SELECT instructions) are terminated,
and the SIGL special variable is set to the line number where the diversion
occurred.

Examples:

    signal bill                      /* Jump to label BILL */
    fred='pete'; signal value pete   /* Jump to label PETE */
    signal on error          /* Handle ERROR' conditions by jumping to ERROR */
    signal on notready name Bubba    /* Handle NOTREADYs by jumping to BUBBA */
    signal off error             /* Handle ERRORs by the normal REXX process */
