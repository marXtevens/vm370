TIME function

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| TIME([option])                                                              |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+

Returns the current local time in the format specifed by the option.  Only the
first character of the option is examined, and is treated in uppper case.

If the option is specifed as 'CIVIL' the function returns the tine in the 
form 'hh:mmxx' where hh is 1 to 12 without a leading zero, and xx is either
'am' or 'pm'.

If the option is specifed as 'ELAPSED' the function returns 'sssssssss.uuuuuu',
the number of seconds and microseconds since the elapsed time clock was 
started or reset.  The number will have no leading zeroes or blanks, and is
not affected by the NUMERIC DIGITs setting.  The elapsed time clock starts the
first time a REXX program calls TIME('ELAPSED') or TIME('RESET'), which
return 0.

If the option is specifed as 'HOURS' the function returns the number of
complete hours since midnight in the form 'hh' with no leading zeroes or blanks.

If the option is specifed as 'LONG' the function returns the time in the form
'hh:mm:ss.uuuuuu', where 'hh:mm:ss' is in the same form as TIME('NORMAL'),
and uuuuuu is the number of microseconds, which is always 6 digits.

If the option is specifed as 'MINUTES' the function returns the number of
complete minutes since midnight in the form 'mmmm' with no leading zeroes or
blanks.

If the option is specifed as 'NORMAL', or omitted, the function returns the
time in the form 'hh:mm:ss' (e.g., '04:41:37').

If the option is specifed as 'RESET' the function returns just as in
TIME('ELAPSED'), and the elapsed time clock is reset to 0.

If the option is specifed as 'SECONDS' the function returns the number
complete seconds since midnight in the form 'sssss' with no leading zeroes or
blanks.

Examples:

    TIME()    == '16:54:22'  /* perhaps */
    TIME('c') == '4:54pm'
    TIME('H') == 16
    TIME('L') == '16:54:22.123456'
    TIME('M') == 1014        /* 54 + 60*16 */
    TIME('n') == '16:54:22'
    TIME('s') == 60862       /* 22+60*(54+60*16) */
