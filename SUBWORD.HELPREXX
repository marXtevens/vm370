SUBWORD function

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| SUBWORD(string, start, [length])                                            |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+

Returns the portion of string starting at the start word number and running for
length blank-separated words.  If length is omitted, the rest of the string is
returned.  All blanks between the selected words are returned unchanged, and
no leading or trailing blanks are returned.  If start exceeds the number of
words in the string, a null string is returned.

Examples:

    SUBWORD('Now is the  time',2,2) == 'is the'
    SUBWORD('Now is the  time',3)   == 'the  time'
    SUBWORD('Now is the  time',5)   == ''
