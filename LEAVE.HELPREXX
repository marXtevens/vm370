LEAVE instruction

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| LEAVE [name];                                                               |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+

The LEAVE instruction terminates the execution of a repeating DO instruction,
without regard to its condition controls.

The name, if specified must match the variable named on one of the executing DO
instructions.  The named instruction, and any others active within it, are
terminated.

Examples:

    /* displays 1, 2, 3 */
    do i=l to 5
      say i
      if i=3 then leave
      end

    /* displays 1, 2, 3, 2, 4, 6, 3, 6, 9 */
    do i=1 to 3
      do j=1 to 2
        do k=1 to 5
          say i*j*k
          if k=3 then leave j
          end
        end
      end
