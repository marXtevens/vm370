B2X function

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| B2X(binary-string)                                                          |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+

Returns a hexadecimal string (i.e., composed of the characters 0-9 and A-F),
that is a conversion from the specified binary-string (i.e., composed of the
characters 0 and 1).  If the binary-string is null (i.e., ''), a null string
is returned (i.e., '').  The binary-string is padded on the left with '0'
characters such that the length is a multiple of 4 (e.g., '1' -> '0001',
'101010' -> '00101010').  The binary-string may contain blanks at 4-character
boundaries, which will be ignored (e.g., '10 1010', but not '1010 10').

Examples:

    B2X('11000011')    == 'C3'
    B2X('l0111')       == '17'
    B2X ('101')        == '5'
    B2X('l 1111 0000') == 'lF0'
