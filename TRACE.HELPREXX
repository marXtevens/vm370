TRACE instruction and function

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| TRACE [ specification | [VALUE] expression | number ]                       |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+

This instruction changes the current tracing specification.  If the number
parameter is specified, as a positive whole number, that many interactive trace
prompts are suppressed.  If it is specified as a negative whole number, tracing
is suspended for that many clauses.  Otherwise, the specification is taken from
either the specification parameter or from the value of the expression.  If the
expression starts with a special character, the VALUE keyword may be omitted.
The tracing specification consists of an optional '?', toggling interactive
tracing on or off, followed by a trace setting.  The setting is treated as
upper case, and only the first character is examined.

If the setting is 'ALL', then all clauses are traced.

If the setting is 'COMMANDS', then all commands are traced before execution,
and any non-zero return code is displayed.

In bREXX, if the setting is 'DEBUG' and the DEBUG option was specified when it
was compiled, the internal debugger status is toggled between enabled and
disabled.

If the setting is 'ERROR', then any command with a non-zero return code is
traced with its return code.

If the setting is 'FAILURE', then any command with a negative return code is
traced with its return code.  This is the same as 'NORMAL'

If the setting is 'INTERMEDIATES', then all clauses are traced before
execution, along with all terms and results of evaluation and name
substitution.

If the setting is 'LABELS', then all labels are traced during execution.

If the setting is 'NORMAL', which is the default, then any command with a
negative return code is traced with its return code.

If the setting is 'OFF', then nothing is traced.

If the setting is 'RESULTS', then all clauses are traced before execution,
along with all results of evaluation and any values assigned in ARG, PARSE,
and PULL clauses.

In bREXX, if the setting is 'SCAN', nothing happens.

| TRACE([option])                                                             |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+

Returns the current TRACE setting, and changes it if the option is specified.
The option consists of either or both of a prefix and TRACE setting.  If the
prefix is specified as '?', then interactive tracing is enabled.  If the
setting is specified, it must be a single letter, and will be treated as
upper case.  The values are the first letter of the valid settings for the
TRACE instruction.

Example:

    TRACE()    == 'N'  /* normally */
    TRACE('I') == 'N'
    TRACE('A') == 'I'  /* afterwards */
