+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+

This instruction may be used to choose which of several paths of execution to 
perform, depending on the values of sevreal different expressions. There must 
be at least one WHEN clause, and there is no limit on how many there can be. 
Each WHEN clause is processed in sequence, by evalutating the expression, which 
must result in 0 or 1.  If the result is 1, then instruction in the THEN phrase 
is executed, and execution continues after the END instruction.  If none of the 
WHEN expressions results in 1, and there is an OTHERWISE clause, then 
instructions in it are executed, and execution continues after the END 
instruction. If none of the WHEN expressions results in 1, and there is no 
OTHERWISE clause, an error occurs. 


Examples:

    Testfile myfile
    select
      when rc=O then do
        Erase myfile
        say 'File' myfile 'existed, now erased'
        end
      when rc=28 | rc=36 then say myfile 'does not exist'
      otherwise
        say 'Unexpected return code "'re'" from TESTFILE'
        exit re
      end /* Select */
