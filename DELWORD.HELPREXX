DELWORD function

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| DELWORD(string, start, [length])                                            |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+

Returns a copy of string with the substring starting at the start word number
and running for length words removed.  If length is omitted, the rest of the
string is removed.  If start is more than the string's length in words, the
string is returned unchanged.  Any blanks following the last deleted word are
also deleted.

Examples:

    DELWORD('Now is the  time',2,2) == 'Now time'
    DELWORD('Now is the time ',3)   == 'Now is '
    DELWORD('Now  time' ,5)         == 'Now  time'
